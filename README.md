# Ray-Tracer
An implementation of a basic ray tracer.
A ray tracer is a computer graphics technique used to generate realistic images by simulating the path of light as it interacts with objects in a virtual scene. It works by tracing rays of light from a virtual camera through each pixel, calculating how they bounce, reflect, and refract off surfaces, thus creating accurate shadows, reflections, and other lighting effects. Ray tracing is widely used in fields like gaming, animation, and visualization to achieve photorealistic visualizations.
